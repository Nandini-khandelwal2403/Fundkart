 <p class="para" style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; line-height: 30px;">The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused the greatest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War.
 Already, thousands of lives have been lost, and millions of livelihoods have been disrupted through displacement, lost
 homes, and lost incomes. We, like so many others, are shocked by the unfolding humanitarian tragedy and the
 consequences of this brutal war.
 <br>
 Daily help
 Initial estimates are that $250 million per month in funding will be needed to cover partial income losses for 2.6
 million people who are expected to fall into poverty.
 
 Providing the most vulnerable with a basic income of $5.50 per day would cost $430 million a month, UNDP said.
 
 Ukraine’s neighbours who have struggled to cope with the more than three million refugees created also need help, the UN
 agency said.
 
 To that end, UNDP is already working with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, on resilience and development measures for those
 displaced by the violence, focusing on support to refugees and host communities through income generation and
 employment.

The invasion of Ukraine is causing a massive humanitarian crisis. In addition to the pain and suffering experienced by
those inside Ukraine, there are already more than three million people seeking refuge in neighboring nations, with
similar numbers displaced within Ukraine. As in other major conflicts and refugee crises—including those in Syria and
Yemen—it will be a gargantuan task for the world community to aid, shelter, and host these unfortunate people.
<br><br><br>
The cost of direct damage to Ukraine's infrastructure amid Russia's ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated $63
billion, according to an analysis by the Kyiv School of Economics.
<br><br><br>
Shocking images and videos have emerged in recent weeks showing just some of the devastation across Ukraine since
Russian forces attacked on Feb. 24. Where businesses, homes, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure once stood,
there are now massive piles of unrecognizable rubble and crumbling shells of concrete.
<br><br><br>
The latest analysis shows that, as of March 24, at least 4,431 residential buildings, 92 factories and warehouses, 378
institutions of secondary and higher education, 138 health care institutions, 12 airports, seven thermal power plants
and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, destroyed or seized in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion
on Feb. 24 -- totaling an estimated $62,889,000. Compared to the previous estimate published on March 17, net growth
amounted to $3.5 billion, according to the KSE Institute.
<br><br><br>
Meanwhile, Ukraine's overall economic losses due to the war -- taking into account both direct losses calculated from
the project as well as indirect losses, like GDP decline -- range from $543 billion to $600 billion, according to an
estimate by the KSE Institute and the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy.

The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and its effect on neighbouring countries has inspired people to collect donations.
But these well-meaning efforts can cause headaches for those helping locally. In aid circles, the mantra has long been
“cash is best”.
<br><br><br>
Cash donations may feel impersonal. It is much more fulfilling to pack stuffed animals and imagine the smiles they will
put on the faces of traumatised children. Many worry that cash donations may never reach the refugees from Ukraine, but
disappear somewhere on the way.
<br><br><br>
That fear can be alleviated with a little research. Many countries offer online registers of charities and charity
evaluators provide further information. Transparency in humanitarian aid is improving. Many established organisations
publish detailed information about their work and finances on their websites.
