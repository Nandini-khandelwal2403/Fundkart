      Cash donations may feel impersonal. It is much more fulfilling
      to pack stuffed animals and imagine
      the smiles they will put on the faces of traumatised children. Many worry that cash donations may never reach the
      refugees
      from Ukraine, but disappear somewhere on the way. But it does not happen anyway if you donate through Fundkart.
